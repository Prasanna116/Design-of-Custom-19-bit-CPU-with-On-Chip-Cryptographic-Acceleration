# Design-of-Custom-19-bit-CPU-with-On-Chip-Cryptographic-Acceleration


## üìå Overview  
This project implements a **Custom RISC-style Processor** with a **19-bit fixed instruction format**, designed using **Verilog HDL** and verified using extensive testbenches written to meticulously monitor the working of each instruction. The design involves a **5-Stage Pipelined Architecture** with 5 different Instructions along with a in-built cryptographic unit for encryption/decryption operations. The processor supports 20 different types of instruction opertions with additional spaces left for future inclusion. 

The processor supports a modular datapath, multiple instruction formats, and extensibility for specialized operations such as **cryptography** and **FFT**.  

All modules are integrated in a **top module** (`cus19_top_module.sv`) and tested with **Extensive testbenches**. Simulation and waveform verification were performed in **ModelSim** and **EDA Playground (EPWave)**.
